# Targpred project repository

Repository of data and scripts needed to run the TargPred resource.  


## Repository Contents
Running the Dockerfile will assemble the TargPred proof-of-concept resource which 
contains only schizophrenia GWAS data and associated GRBs. The dockerfile builds the resource image from the contents of the shinyApp directory.  
For more details see:

The reactable_testing directory contains a work-in-progress version of the resource which is currently being expanded
to include all studies in the GWAS Catalog (and the associated genomic regulatory block information).
